# OpenTelemetry Laravel auto-instrumentation

## Requirements

* OpenTelemetry extension
* OpenTelemetry SDK and exporters (required to actually export traces)

## Overview
Currently only root span creation is supported (Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel::handle hook).

To export spans, you will need to create and register a `TracerProvider` early in your application's
lifecycle. This can be done either manually or using SDK autoloading.

### Using SDK autoloading

See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php#sdk-autoloading

### Manual setup

```php
<?php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$tracerProvider = /*create tracer provider*/;
$scope = \OpenTelemetry\API\Common\Instrumentation\Configurator::create()
    ->withTracerProvider($tracerProvider)
    ->activate();

//your application runs here

$scope->detach();
$tracerProvider->shutdown();
```

## Installation via composer

```bash
$ composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry-auto-laravel
```

## Installing dependencies and executing tests

From Laravel subdirectory:

```bash
$ composer install
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```
